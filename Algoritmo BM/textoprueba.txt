Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken, 
Take the land, that must be taken. 
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken, 
Devour worlds, smite forsaken 

Rise up from your thousandth year of sleep, 
Break forth from your grave eternally. 

We will die and then we'll all be burned 
Mustakrakish king and death to worlds. 

I command you to 
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, 
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise,
